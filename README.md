# PascalsTriangle
Code was used for research conducted on Pascal's Triangle (to prove findigns). 
My group and I derived recursive formulae for a pattern we founded called Consecutive Rows with Even Middle Terms (CREMT).
We then created these programs to generate and predict the total percentage of even numbers per row compared to every row before that. 
We created a different program where odds were 1 and evens were 0 and it correlated the triangle row and generated 1’s and 0’s back. 
With this formula, we found that every row after a CREMT contains all odd numbers. This was the reason for an exponential growth of even values and exponential decay of odd values throughout the whole, infinite triangle.
